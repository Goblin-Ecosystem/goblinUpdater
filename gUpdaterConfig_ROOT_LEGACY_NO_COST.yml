#
# update configuration file
#
# scenario for legacy update at root level:
# - we may accept CVE (but give a big weight to it)
# - we do not want any COST (constraint)
# - popularity and freshness are balanced
# - potential for change (releases) is only computed at root level
# - potential for change (releases) uses only MORE_RECENT versions
# - change edges are only computed at root level
# - costs are computed with MARACAS
# - pessimistic view of unknown costs
# - no cost limit
